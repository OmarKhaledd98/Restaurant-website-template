## Reflection

This was a 3 day long project. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

Originally I wanted to build a website that allowed users to know about our restaurant. I started this process by using html and css simultaneously then adding javascript.

One of the main challenges I ran into was how to make this template responsive. This lead me to spend a lot of time on a research, At the end I reached the soultion using media query.
